I've been hooked to [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) recently - <!--more--> hats off to the website owner (also congrats to him cuz I think NYT bought the site for allegedly low seven figures. :D). Since I've spent much time on cracking its daily challenges, I figured why not write one myself!

As for my little knock-off program, the rules are very simple and are consistent with the official Wordle. For each guess, you get hints on:

1. right character in the right place
2. right character but wrong place
3. no such character

That's it. And you only have a maximum of 6 attempts too.

Since UI isn't really my forte, I sorta ~~skipped~~ skimmed on that. Here's a sample output of my little program from command line:

```text
Welcome to Xiaofeng's own version of command line Wordle. You have a maximum of 6 attempts. Good luck!
Enter your 5-letter guess of word: sunday
Please input a 5-letter word
Enter your 5-letter guess of word: solid
Results:
uppercase = right character in the right place; 
lowercase = right character but wrong place; 
hyphen    = no such character
attempt 1: solid  --> - o L - - 

Enter your 5-letter guess of word: bully
Results:
uppercase = right character in the right place; 
lowercase = right character but wrong place; 
hyphen    = no such character
attempt 1: solid  --> - o L - - 
attempt 2: bully  --> - - L L - 

Enter your 5-letter guess of word: jello
Results:
uppercase = right character in the right place; 
lowercase = right character but wrong place; 
hyphen    = no such character
attempt 1: solid  --> - o L - - 
attempt 2: bully  --> - - L L - 
attempt 3: jello  --> - E L L O 

Enter your 5-letter guess of word: hello
Congrats, you have cracked this!

```

And the code in Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3


from collections import Counter, OrderedDict
from enum import Enum
from random import choice
from sys import exit


class Result(Enum):
    MATCHED = 10
    MISPLACED = 20
    NONE = 30

class Wordle:

    # All in lowercase. should really hide this and/or get a much bigger dictionary
    corpus = [
        'hello',
        'those',
        'skill',
        'shard',
        'elder',
        'pleat',
        'tesla'
    ]

    def __init__(self, try_limit):
        self.try_limit = try_limit
        self.tries = 0
        self.secret_word = choice(self.corpus)
        self.snaps = []

    def check(self, word):
        assert len(word) == len(self.secret_word)
    
        if self.tries >= self.try_limit:
            exit("Sorry, you have run out number of attempts. Better luck on the next Wordle!")

        self.tries += 1
        
        word = word.lower()
        if word == self.secret_word:
            exit('Congrats, you have cracked this!')

        # Technically we can use list instead, since the key is just the index. But I just love OrderedDict too much
        res = OrderedDict()
        expected = Counter(self.secret_word)
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if word[i] == self.secret_word[i]:
                res[i] = Result.MATCHED
                expected[word[i]] -= 1
                continue

            if expected[word[i]] > 0:
                res[i] = Result.MISPLACED
                expected[word[i]] -= 1
            else:
                res[i] = Result.NONE
        
        self.snaps.append((word,res))
        self.print_snaps_()

    def print_snaps_(self):
        print('Results:\nuppercase = right character in the right place; \nlowercase = right character but wrong place; \nhyphen    = no such character')
        for i, snap in enumerate(self.snaps):
            print(f'attempt {i+1}:', end=' ')
            self.print_snap_(snap)
        print()
        
    def print_snap_(self, snap):
        """
        :type snap: (str, OrderedDict)
        """
        word, res = snap
        print(word, ' --> ', end='')
        for k, v in res.items():
            if v == Result.MATCHED:
                print(word[k].upper(), end=' ')
            if v == Result.MISPLACED:
                print(word[k], end=' ')
            if v == Result.NONE:
                print('-', end=' ')
        print()

if __name__ == '__main__':

    MAX_GUESS = 6
    wordle = Wordle(MAX_GUESS)

    print("Welcome to Xiaofeng's own version of command line Wordle. You have a maximum of 6 attempts. Good luck!")
    
    while True:
        try:
            guess = input("Enter your 5-letter guess of word: ")
            if len(guess) != 5:
                print("Please input a 5-letter word")
                continue

            wordle.check(guess)
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)

```

A couple things to improve:

1. The corpus is definitely too small and shouldn't be in plaintext for sure. Maybe hook up to some API and encrypt it.
2. The input guesses should be valid words but right now 5-letter gibberish would pass too. Need to validate input.
3. A bit more thinking needed for edge cases on repeated characters.

Otherwise, this two-hour side hustle was a bit fun!
