I did a quick search today, since we all know Google doesn't lie.. <!--more--> so this must be true then:

![search](../assets/images/20210401/search.jpg)

I'm glad we cleared that out!

Feel free to check it out with Google. I've filled in the [query](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Most+Handsome+Man+Alive) for ya!

Did you find it? Haha! I actually did this mock page a long long time ago, inspired by a [Jimmy Kimmel skit](https://youtu.be/MyGJXLxtVEo) - it sill makes me laugh today. I forgot how I made this by now actually, maybe that was before my CSS skills got rusty. Anyhow, Happy April Fools' Day! :D
