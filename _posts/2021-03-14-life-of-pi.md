I know I had the title of *Life of Pi*, but this isn't gonna be about the great Ang Lee movie [Life of Pie (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454876/), I meant sure the protagnist's name "Pi" was indeeded named after the greek letter `pi`. But this post is actually inpired by Pi Day, March 14 aka 3/14), otherwise I probably won't be this prolific in writing posts (twice a week might be too many!). So what is `pi`? In short, it's the mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, with the value of:

> 3.141592653589793238462643383279...

Believe it or not, I actaully just manually typed the above digits by heart. Back in the days, I used to be able to recite far more digits, prob close to 100 even. Unfortunately that's how much stayed in my memories as I grew older. I did a quick lookup online, that's actually correct! Woohoo!

I love the thriller drama [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/), in fact I might've watched the entire series more than once. The `pi` was referenced many times, which I quote from [Fandom](https://personofinterest.fandom.com/wiki/Pi):

> Finch impersonates a high school teacher to approach their next number, a teenager attending this school. He lectures to the class on how `pi` is assumed to contain any finite sequence of digits within its neverending decimal sequence, and stresses the fact that "now, whatever [they] do with this information, will be entirely up to [the student]".

That's so profound. You can actually find your social security number, date of birth, in fact, any finiate sequence of digits in `pi`, as long as you search further enough. I've found a [website](http://mypiday.com/) that visualizes search for birthdays in `pi` for you.

You can put your birthday any formt you like, for instance, say a person was born December 31, 1999. I just did a search on the website for `19991231`, and it says it's found at `1,012,191-th` digit in `pi` (isn't this fascinating?):

I'd like to ramble a bit about the nature of `pi`, how little we human race know about it really. So `pi` is a what we call irrational number. To understand it, we'd have to know what a rational number is.  

## Rational Number

Rational numbers, are in short, the numbers that can be represented by quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q, when p and q are relatively prime / coprime.

An example would be `1/3`, which is `0.33333..` to the infinity. 

## Irrational Number 


square root of 2. story. 

proof by contradition.

mocked by class? 

## To Infinity and Beyond

So rational numbers and irrational number together make up what we known as `real numbers`. Why the term `real` you ask? Cuz the crazy mathematicians clearly weren't happy with the number we had available, they had to invent the `imaginary numbers`, also know as `complex numbers`. That is, what is the square root of `-1`? The answer is, no `real` number is, since the square of any real number is greater than or equal to zero. So the mathematicians came up with an `imaginary number`: 

> i<sup>2</sup> = -1

You might wonder why? Why did mathematicians do that? To answer that, you'll actually need to read a lot more books. But in short, it's being used our real daily life, and is essential you might say cuz it's heavily used. Ask BC Hydro analysts - I believe they can tell how imporant it is in analyzing electricity!

I'm ashamed to admit that, as much as I write code for a living nowadays, I used to study mathematics for 6 whole years as a colleage and graduate school major (#washedupmathematician). While I couldn't make a career out of mathematician, I had a genuine interest in mathematics and still appreciate the beauty of it. I enjoy the pure pleasure of thinking, deducing and reasoning.


It's probably considered as one of the most unpractical majors, next to Philosophy perhaps. But without it, there will be no foundations of modern technlogy.

Great mathematicians are geniouses that look beyond their time, and can sometimes be perceived as borderline lunatics. In fact, Greg Cantor, the father of modern set theory, was actually considered bipolar and spent his last days in a sanatorium. His theory, was indeed conterintutive, like the order of infinity, that is, the're different levels of infinity. 

Let me ask you this? Do we have more even number or natural numbers? 

In the epic Chiense scify novel *Three Body* (Chinese: 三体), there're different levels of cosmos civilaztion. The more advanced civilization (not us earth people for sure) had achieved weaponizing the laws of mathematics and physics, say, they can bend the speed of light, or even the laws of causality. Now that's beyond our wildest imaginations!

As a programmer and enginneer, I'm ofenttimes amazed and buffled by the fact we have constants, like light speed and `pi`, in our real worlds. That can be a discussion leading to religions and higher power or a designer of the worlds we're living in, so I won't go there. But still, progammers would know how often we just declare a constant:

```csharp
public const LightSpeed = 299792458
```

So what if we're really living in a simulated environment that's administered by a higher civilazation, like a `microverse` in one of the episodes in Rick and Morty? Or if we're just brains in a vat really?
