Once upon a time, I used to own my personal domain from GoDaddy but I let it expire, mostly out of my tardiness and reluctance to maintain. 

Recently I realized many of my coworkers actually own their personal domains/websites. So I figured maybe I should get one for myself, to park my train of thoughts from time to time, and.. ramble about stuff - so guess what I did today? :D Luckily, my name aint that common, so NO thanks, I don't want xiaofengyue95.com! 

TBH, I was thinking medium but I think this is probably where the cool kids hang out anyways! 

Updated on 2/20/2021: I've migrated this first post to GitHub Pages free hosting. Yay!
