Before I realized it, it's June already!

In this January, I made some simplified resolution items - usually the new year resolutions didn't make it through February, but this year I'm not sure if that's due to the pandemic, I actually made some headways. I share them as follows:

1. Become a reader and read more books: I've read 6 books this year to date!
2. Become a runner and lose some pounds: The running part didn't happen as much as I hoped. But I did lose over 7 pounds so far since January, mostly due to dieting.
3. Start a pet project in AI field: This is yet to happen..

Recently at work, a fellow PM showcased one of the previous work of her Machine Learning team. I realized I haven't fully taken advantage of the complimentary employee Azure monthly credit - what a crime! So here I am, trying to start crossing another item off my resolution list. :)

You could scrape the hotdog and not-hog pictures from [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/), or.. you could find a ready set from Kaggle as luckily it has sanitized a [dataset copy](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog) for us!

## Azurify It!

Been wanting to do this, but I was too cheap to subscribe to any cloud computing plans. But hey, now Uncle MS is giving me a monthly allowance for Azure!
