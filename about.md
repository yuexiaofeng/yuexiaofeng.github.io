Yo! 

Xiaofeng here. I'm a software engineer based in the beautiful city that's called Vancouver. Been living here since 2018. 

Before coming to Vancouver, I was working and living in Shanghai for quite a few years. 

Outside of work, I love watching movies, especially the old ones. 

Here're some fun facts about myself:
 
1. I am a huge fan of Rick and Morty. Yes I know I'm a grownup, but the show aint really for kids! Do yourself a favor to watch it if you haven't
2. My last name Yue (岳) means Great Mountain in Chinese, although I haven't hiked a lot in BC yet..  
3. Part of my first name (峰) means Peak in Chinese.. IKR? In a parallel universe, there must be a great explorer and mountaineer Xiaofeng Yue who's our Edmund Hillary equivalent
4. I used to study in Harbin, a city in Northern China that's close to Russia. Winter there can be -30C degrees (sounds familiar eh?)

This is a space for me to ramble about random stuff, mostly likely on the areas of Tech, Book, and Movie, etc (Should be available for filtering by Tags). I'll refrain from talking about politics of any kind, in case I need to run for PM one day. :) 

PS. I turned off Disqus for this site, mostly cuz I don't expect a lot of traffic or comments. But if you like to reach out, feel free to hunt me down on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaofengyue/). 

Peace!
