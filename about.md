Yo! 

Xiaofeng here. I'm a software engineer based in the beautiful city that's called Vancouver (the Canadian one). Been living here since 2018. 

Before coming to Vancouver, I was working and living in Shanghai for quite a few years. 

Outside of work, I love watching movies, especially the old ones. 

Here're some fun facts about myself:
 
1. I am a huge fan of Rick and Morty. Yes I know I'm a grownup, but the show aint really for kids! Do yourself a favor, watch it if you haven't
2. My last name "Yue" (岳) means Great Mountain in Chinese, although I haven't hiked a lot in BC yet..  
3. Part of my first name "feng" (峰) means Peak in Chinese.. IKR? In a parallel universe, there must be a great explorer and mountaineer Xiaofeng Yue who's our Edmund Hillary equivalent
4. I’m not saying my name is unique but according to the Ministry of Public Security of China, as of February 2021, there’re exactly 18 other people in China share the same full name as mine
5. I used to study in Harbin, a city in Northern China that's close to Russia. Winter there can be -30C degrees (sounds familiar eh?)

This is a space for me to ramble about random stuff, most likely on the areas of Tech, Book, and Movie, etc (Should be categorized in Tags). I'll refrain from talking about politics of any kind, in case I need to run for PM one day. :) 

PS. I turned off Disqus for this site, mostly cuz I don't expect a lot of traffic or comments. But if you would like to reach out, feel free to hunt me down on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaofengyue/). 

Peace!
