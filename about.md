Yo!

Xiaofeng here. I'm a software engineer based in the beautiful city that's called Vancouver (the Canadian one). I also lived in a couple other countries for quite a few years before relocating in 2018.

As for my name `Xiaofeng` - it's pronounced very similar to SHAW-phone[▷](../assets/heisenberg.gif){:target="_blank"}. It came from the combination of two Chinese characters romanized by pinyin (literally means "spelled sounds"). So in this case, it's xiào (4th tone i.e. falling tone) + fēng (1st tone i.e. flat tone) = Xiaofeng.

But for those who are not familiar with the Chinese language system, here's a GNU-flavored mnemonic recursive acronym that I totes made up to help with the spelling (for the record, I don't think the acronym XIAOFENG exists for reals):

>**X**iaofeng **I**s **A**n **O**ld-**F**ashioned **ENG**ineer

Some fun facts about myself:

1. My family name `Yue` means Great Mountain in Chinese, although I should hike a lot more to live up to the name! In the words of the old country, `Yue` is `岳` - since Chinese is a pictogram language, a few millenniums ago, the character was initially scripted on oracle bones to resemble mountains before it evolved to its modern form on the right: ![yue](../assets/images/yue_oracle.png)
2. Part of my first name, `feng` (Chinese character: `峰`; similar etymology to my surname `岳`, as they share the same building block `山` that hints a character is mountain-related), means Peak in Chinese.. IKR? In a parallel universe, there must be a great explorer and mountaineer `Xiaofeng Yue` who's our Edmund Hillary equivalent!
3. I don't like labels on myself (definitely not a nihilist) but I have to admit that I am a huge fan of [Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/){:target="_blank"}. Do yourself a favor, watch it if you haven't.
4. I used to study in Harbin, a city in Northern China that's not far from Siberia. Winter there can be -30 degrees Celsius (sounds familiar eh?).
5. I have two master's degrees - one in math; the other in computer science. Barely a *fun* fact as both were somewhat Pyrrhic victories that inflicted certain amount of pain upon me at the time. But just as what people say, while pain is inevitable, suffering is optional, I learnt so much about discipline and life priorities (and of course, knowledge too) along the journey, so I hereby decree this as a fun fact (of present day :D).
6. I once won (Hu) on the first tile discarded in a Sichuan-style Mahjong 🀅, which is called Earth's Grace. Statistically, the chance is 1 in ~3.2 million. To do a back-of-the-envelope calculation, a game typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, so let's say 5 games per hour on average, give or take. If we played 8 hours straight every single day, for 365 days a year, then this'd happen once in about 219 years, i.e. roughly from when Napoleon crowned himself emperor in 1804, all the way to 2023.

This is my corner of the web, and is an uncensored personal space - I am the self-appointed (and opinionated) [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life){:target="_blank"} here. I like to ramble about random stuff, most likely on the areas of Tech, Books, Movies and whatnot, which should be categorized in <a href="/tags">Tags</a>. I will refrain from talking about politics of any kind though, in case I need to run for office one day!

PS. I turned off Disqus for this site, mostly cuz I don't expect a lot of traffic or comments, and that I'd like to keep it Web 1.0, at least for the time being. But if you would like to reach out, feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaofengyue/){:target="_blank"}.

PPS. It goes without saying - yet I probably should say it anyways: The opinions expressed in this blog are my own views and not those of my employer.

Peace!
