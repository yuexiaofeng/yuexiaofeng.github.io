Yo! 

Xiaofeng here. I'm a software engineer based in the beautiful city that's called Vancouver (the Canadian one). I also worked and lived in Shanghai for quite a few years before relocating in 2018.

As for my name `Xiaofeng` - it's pronounced very similar to SHAW-phone. It came from the combination of two Chinese characters romanized by pinyin (literally means "spelled sounds"). So in this case, it's xiào (4th tone i.e. falling tone) + fēng (1st tone i.e. flat tone) = Xiaofeng. But for those who are not familiar with the Chinese language system, here's a GNU-flavored mnemonic recursive acronym that I totes made up to help with the spelling (just to clarify, I don't think the acronym XIAOFENG exists for reals):

>**X**iaofeng **I**s **A**n **O**ld-**F**ashioned **ENG**ineer

Some fun facts about myself:
 
1. I am a huge fan of Rick and Morty. Do yourself a favor, watch it if you haven't
2. My last name `Yue` (Chinese character: 岳) means Great Mountain in Chinese, although I haven't hiked a lot in BC yet..
3. Part of my first name `feng` (Chinese character: 峰) means Peak in Chinese.. IKR? In a parallel universe, there must be a great explorer and mountaineer Xiaofeng Yue who's our Edmund Hillary equivalent
4. I’m not saying my name is unique but based on a query to a central government database, as of February 2021, there were exactly 18 other people in China shared the same full name as mine
5. I used to study in Harbin, a city in Northern China that's not far from Siberia. Winter there can be -30C degrees (sounds familiar eh?)

This is a space for me to ramble about random stuff, most likely on the areas of Tech, Books, and Movies (I love old ones!), etc - should be categorized in <a href="/tags">Tags</a>. I'll refrain from talking about politics of any kind, in case I need to run for office one day. :)

PS. I turned off Disqus for this site, mostly cuz I don't expect a lot of traffic or comments, and that I'd like to keep it Web 1.0, at least for the time being. But if you would like to reach out, feel free to hunt me down on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaofengyue/).

Peace!
